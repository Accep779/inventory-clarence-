description: >-
  Framework for reactivating dormant customers through systematic segmentation, multi-touch campaigns, and data-driven optimization. Use when the user needs to: revive inactive customers, reduce customer churn, design win-back campaigns, optimize dormant customer engagement, build reactivation funnels, or develop automated reactivation systems for e-commerce or SaaS businesses.

# Customer Reactivation Framework

## Segmentation Model

Dormant customers must be segmented across multiple dimensions before campaign design:

### Core Segmentation Dimensions

**1. Dormancy Range**
- 60-90 days: Early warning
- 90-120 days: Active risk
- 120-180 days: Critical dormancy
- 180+ days: Deep dormancy

**2. Purchase History**
- High-margin buyers
- Low-margin buyers
- Subscription vs. one-time
- Repeat vs. single purchase

**3. AOV Tier**
- Low-value segment
- Mid-value segment
- High-value segment (whales)

**4. Engagement Pattern**
- Opens emails, no clicks
- Clicks, no purchases
- Zero engagement (dark)

**5. Product Affinity**
- Category clusters from purchase history
- Browse behavior patterns
- Cart abandonment items

**6. Acquisition Channel**
- Paid social (FB/IG/TikTok)
- Organic search
- Email/referral
- Direct

## Multi-Touch Reactivation Sequence

Sequential campaign structure across 7 touches.

### Touch 1: Pattern Interrupt (Pattern: Curiosity)
**Objective**: Recapture attention without selling. 
No product mentions, no discounts. Use curiosity-based subject lines and a personal tone.

### Touch 2: Personalized Recommendation (Pattern: Relevance)
**Objective**: Demonstrate relevance based on purchase + browse history. Category affinity matching. No incentives yet.

### Touch 3: Soft Incentive (Pattern: Value Reward)
**Objective**: Reward without devaluing. Use account credits or loyalty points instead of % discounts.

### Touch 4: Social Proof (Pattern: Trust)
**Objective**: Rebuild trust through customer reviews and community highlights. Use social proof from similar customer profiles.

### Touch 5: Scarcity/Status Trigger (Pattern: Urgency)
**Objective**: Create urgency with limited drops or exclusive access. Best for deep dormancy.

### Touch 6: Win-Back Offer (Pattern: Economic Incentive)
**Objective**: First aggressive discount (20%+). Time-limited (48-72 hours).

### Touch 7: Final Nudge (Pattern: Finality)
**Objective**: Final decision point. Use loss aversion ("Should we close your account?").

## Core Metrics Dashboard

1. **Reactivation Rate by Cohort** = Reactivated Customers ÷ Total Dormant in Cohort
2. **Time to Reactivate** = Days from first touch to purchase
3. **Reactivated LTV** = Post-reactivation purchase value over 90 days
4. **Channel Attribution** = Which touch/channel drove conversion
5. **Incentive Efficiency** = Revenue ÷ Discount Cost by offer type

## Automation Architecture Requirements

**Scoring Engine**: Tracks churn probability and triggers appropriate campaigns.
**Incentive Optimizer**: Starts with minimum incentive and escalates based on response, protecting margins.
**Performance Monitor**: Identifies underperforming variants and auto-pauses ineffective approaches.
