  Framework for clearing slow-moving and dead inventory through systematic segmentation, optimization, and tiered clearance strategies. Use when the user needs to: reduce old stock, improve inventory turnover, execute clearance campaigns, optimize slow-moving SKUs, recover cash from dead inventory, or develop inventory liquidation strategies for e-commerce or retail operations.

# Inventory Clearance Framework

## Inventory Segmentation

Before any clearance action, segment inventory into four categories:

**A. Optimization Candidates**
- Inventory appearing slow due to listing/technical issues
- Indicators: Poor images, incorrect variants, SEO problems, pricing errors
- Action: Fix before discounting

**B. Revival Candidates**
- Previously performed well, now stagnant
- Needs: Bundling, advertising refresh, minor price adjustments
- Action: Strategic repositioning

**C. True Clearance**
- Genuinely slow-moving without technical issues
- Action: Structured discount campaigns

**D. Critical Liquidation**
- Carrying cost exceeds salvage value
- Action: Immediate removal by any means

## Three-Wave Clearance Protocol

### Wave 1: Zero-Cost Optimization

Execute before any discounting:

1. **Listing Quality Audit**
   - Replace low-quality images
   - Rewrite product descriptions
   - Add urgency/scarcity elements
   - Remove underperforming variants
   - Correct shipping weights/dimensions
   - Adjust pricing to optimal velocity band

2. **Expected Recovery**: 10-25% of "dead" stock converts without discounts

### Wave 2: Strategic Bundling

Pair slow inventory with fast-moving products:

**Bundle Types:**
- Hero product + slow mover packages
- Mystery/surprise boxes
- BOGO where free item is slow SKU
- Curated seasonal kits
- Value stack bundles

**Pricing Structure:**
- Bundle price below sum of parts
- Maintain margin on hero product
- Treat slow SKU as "bonus value"

**Expected Recovery**: 25-40% of remaining inventory

### Wave 3: Controlled Discount Events

Execute targeted, time-limited campaigns:

**Mechanics:**
- 48-72 hour flash sales
- Tiered discounts (spend thresholds unlock deeper discounts)
- Email segmentation (target deal-seekers specifically)
- Social proof overlays ("Last 50 units," "Final batch")
- Platform-specific events (TikTok live sales, Instagram stories)

**Alternative Channels:**
- B2B wholesale lots
- Local liquidation partners
- Influencer collaboration boxes
- Outlet marketplace listings

**Critical Rule:** Never run store-wide blanket discounts. Create dedicated clearance sections/events.

**Expected Recovery**: 30-40% of remaining inventory

## Performance Tracking

### Core Metrics Dashboard

Track weekly at minimum:

1. **Sell-Through Rate** = Units Sold ÷ Units Available
2. **Days on Hand** = Current Inventory ÷ Average Daily Sales
3. **Gross Margin Recovery** = (Revenue - COGS) ÷ Original COGS
4. **Velocity Band Distribution** = % of SKUs in each sales velocity tier
5. **SKU Reactivation Rate** = % of "dead" SKUs that resume normal sales

### Primary KPI

**Dead Stock Eradication Rate (DSER)**
= (Starting Dead Inventory - Ending Dead Inventory) ÷ Starting Dead Inventory

Target: 70-90% reduction in 90 days

## Clearance Campaign Execution Checklist

**Pre-Campaign (1 week before):**
- [ ] Complete inventory segmentation
- [ ] Execute Wave 1 optimizations
- [ ] Create bundle configurations
- [ ] Segment email lists
- [ ] Design clearance landing pages
- [ ] Set up tracking parameters

**Campaign Week:**
- [ ] Launch email sequence (Day 1, 3, 7)
- [ ] Post social media announcements
- [ ] Update site banners/CTAs
- [ ] Monitor hourly performance
- [ ] Adjust pricing/visibility based on velocity

**Post-Campaign:**
- [ ] Calculate recovery metrics
- [ ] Document what worked/failed
- [ ] Update forecasting models
- [ ] Plan next cycle

## Common Failure Modes

**Avoid:**
- Discounting before optimization
- Brand-wide discount events
- Ignoring bundle opportunities
- No performance tracking
- Reactive vs. scheduled clearance
- Over-discounting high-value items
- Mixing clearance with regular inventory

## Integration with Forecasting

**Upstream Prevention:**
- Use historical clearance data to flag risky purchase decisions
- Set reorder thresholds based on actual sell-through rates
- Implement automatic alerts when SKUs enter slow-mover status
- Track which suppliers/categories generate most dead stock
- Build clearance probability into initial margin calculations
